1. What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?
	
	Spatial Locality is the act of storing and looking for data close to the proessor.
	When looking for data, the processor will look in the Cache first. If it doesn't find it, it will retrieve a range of memory locations from the RAM and place it in the Cache. This reduces the number of times the processor has to look in the RAM (a much slower operation than simply looking in the Cache).



2. Compare the performance of an Array to a Linked List using the Benchmark module.
	
	- Compare the time it takes to create a 10,000 item Array to appending 10,000 items to a Linked List.
	--- A 10,000 item Array takes around 0.004425 seconds (going up to 0.004884 seconds).
	--- A 10,000 item Linked List takes around 0.005172 seconds (ranging up to  0.005688 seconds).
	- Compare the time it takes to access the 5000th element of the Array and the 5000th Node in the Linked List.
	--- To access an array's 5000th element it takes around 0.000004 seconds (ranging up to 0.000006).
	--- To access a linked list's 5000th element it takes around 0.000385 seconds (ranging up to 0.000402).
	- Compare the time it takes to remove the 5000th element from the Array to removing the 5000th Node in the Linked List.
	--- To delete an array's 5000th element it takes around 0.000010 seconds (ranging up to 0.000014).
	--- To delete a linked list's 5000th element it takes around 0.000664 seconds (ranging up to 0.000700).

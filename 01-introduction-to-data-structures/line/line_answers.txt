1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
	The data structure for the line is an array of strings. 

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
Using the search method, it just loops over the line and checks to see if the element we're looking for matches line[i] (both of which are strings0.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?
This data structure could also represent items being built in an assembly line.

A line at an amusement park ride - line.rb
1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
	The data structure for the line is an array of strings. 

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
Using the search method, it just loops over the line and checks to see if the element we're looking for matches line[i] (both of which are strings0.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?
This data structure could also represent items being built in an assembly line.

Pixels on a computer screen - screen.rb and pixel.rb
1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
The screen's data structure consists of a multidimensional array (ie: arr[y][x], where y is the height of the screen and x is the width). x is only created if the pixel exists (for a better memory usage). # screen = [ [[]],[],[[]] ]
The pixel's data structure consists of a hash will key-value pairs which specify their color ratio and location in the screen.

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
You would search the @screen for a @pixel by looking at the @screen[y][x] position, y being the height of the element you want and x being the width of that element.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?
The same data structure used for the screen/pixel relationship can be used for board games such as chess.
